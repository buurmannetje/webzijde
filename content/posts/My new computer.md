After using a ThinkPad for about a year, I finally decided to build myself a new desktop PC. I wanted something to run Linux Mint on and sometimes play a game. After some research I settled on these parts:

- Fractal Design Meshify 2 Compact Gray
- AMD Ryzen 5 5600G with Radeon Graphics × 6
- Aorus B550 Elite V2
- Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3600MHz
- Corsair RM650
- Samsung SSD 970 EVO 1TB

I opted not to go for a graphics card but use integrated graphics. I don’t game much these days and graphics cards are still crazy expensive.

I’m really happy with the result. It runs very smooth and practically silent.
