Hugo has a great option to create a list in YAML format and then show that data in a template. I created a <a href="https://github.com/buurmannetje/Hugo-Examples/tree/main/Data%20Templates">GitHub repository</a> with the files you need.

If you add these files to your Hugo website and visit yourwebsite.com/movies, you will find a list of movies you've watched.

If you want to add a movie to the list, you can open /data/watched.yml and add the movie.
