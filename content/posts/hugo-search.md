Adding a search function to a static site generator can be tricky. I created a <a href="https://github.com/buurmannetje/Hugo-Examples/tree/main/Searchs">GitHub repository</a> with the files you need.

If you add these files to your Hugo website and visit yourwebsite.com/search, you will find a search page that works!
