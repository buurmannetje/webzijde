5 weeks ago I bought a Google Pixel 6a. I bought it with one reason: install GrapheneOS. I wanted more control over my privacy. Untill that day I've been using my iPhone 13 Mini.

Installing GrapheneOS is ridiculously simple. You visit their <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/web">web installer</a> and follow the steps. My first try gave an error, but that seemed due to a bad USB-C cable. After replacing the cable, I've clicked a few buttons and voila: GrapheneOS is installed.

So far, it has been great! It feels fast and snappy. I've installed some apps via the APK route and that works very well.

The apps I use:

- F-Droid
- Pocket Casts
- Signal
- K-9 Mail
- WhatsApp (yes, I know...)
- Gallery
- OsmAnd~
- Vanadium
- Tasks
