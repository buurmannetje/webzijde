4 months ago I bought a Google Pixel 6a. I bought it with one reason: install GrapheneOS. I wanted more control over my privacy. Untill that day I’ve been using my iPhone 13 Mini.

Installing GrapheneOS is ridiculously simple. You visit their web installer and follow the steps. My first try gave an error, but that seemed due to a bad USB-C cable. After replacing the cable, I’ve clicked a few buttons and voila: GrapheneOS is installed.

In short: this is how Android should be. It’s crazy fast, zero bloat, and the battery lasts (literally) days. I install apps via F-Droid or if there is no FOSS option available, I use the Aurora store. If you have a Pixel phone, I highly recommend using GrapheneOS.well.

The apps I use:

- F-Droid
- Pocket Casts
- Signal
- K-9 Mail
- WhatsApp (yes, I know…)
- Gallery
- OsmAnd~
- Vanadium
- Tasks
- Mullvad
- Aegis
- Forecastie
- Feeder
- Infinity
- NewPipe
- Tusky
